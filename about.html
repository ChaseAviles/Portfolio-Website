        <h1>More About Me:</h1>
        <p>
          <a class="tab">Thank</a> you for visiting my site. My name is Johnathan Chase Aviles, but you can just call me
          Chase. I am a recent college graduate with a bachelorâ€™s degree in computer science. My current goal is to
          become a professional front end web developer and move to full stack when I am ready. Until recently I was
          working as a home inspector with Sharp Eye Inspections. It is a family business and I agreed to work there for
          a year after graduation. I used this time to discover what route in programming I want to take and to practice
          my chosen niche, web development.
        </p>

        <br />

        <p>
          <a class="tab">I</a> married my high school sweetheart in 2017 and we bought our first house in 2018. We
          currently live in Temple, GA. Some of my personal hobbies include exercise, video games, and anything
          involving technology. Since pursuing programming building computers has become one of my favorite hobbies. I
          built the machine I am working on now and one for my wife. She said I cannot buy any more computers/components
          until I get a developer job so I would appreciate the help. But in all seriousness, I have a passion for
          making innovative apps and websites. I have a lot to learn but I want to be one of the best in my field and I
          hope you will consider me for an interview.
